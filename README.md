A Simple React  with Bootstrap-4 Template

Demo - http://shahcreative.com/b4r_demo

This is a simple template that works with react, react-router, webpack and bootstrap 4. 

The webpack-dev-server command will allow you to preview the template using a browser (via localhost:8080).

Using the webpack -p command will build all files to a dist folder. 

I wrote this as a first pass to use as a boilerplate for other themes. 

It may be useful for others who want a standard react-router with webpack setup.
