A Simple Bootstrap-4 with React Template

Demo - http://shahcreative.com/b4r_demo

This is a simple template that works with react, react-router, webpack and bootstrap 4. 

### Usage

The ```$ webpack-dev-server``` command will allow you to preview the template using a browser (via localhost:8080).

The webpack config also makes use of environment variables. They are split into Dev and Production.

Use ``` $ NODE_ENV=production webpack -p ``` for a production build (minified, optimized).

I wrote this primarily as a first pass to use as a boilerplate for other themes. 

It may be useful for others who want a standard react-router with webpack setup.
